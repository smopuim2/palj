This problem tests your basic python coding skills.
You're given a string S(i!=j -> S[i]!=S[j] , may contain), and a integer K(1<=K<=|S|).
When S is sorted in alphabetical order, what's the K-th letter's position before?
Sample input:
ecbad 3
Sample output:
2 (sorted strong is "abcde",which 3rd letter is "c",in position 2)
