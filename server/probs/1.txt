This is the basic problem, just want you to know how to use PALJ.
Actually, you need to calculate A+B (0<=A,b<=10) .
See format below.

Sample input:
2 3
Sample output:
Hello,5!



You should always use these functions to read input or print answer:
in() returns a string, just like input().
out() prints your data, but it only support one list.

For this problem, you may type your script like this:

def solve():
    a,b=in().split();
    a=int(a)
    b=int(b)
    out([a+b])
